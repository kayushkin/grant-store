# grant-store — API contract

`127.0.0.1:8315`. The registry of grants: which principal (a human or a group
from principal-store) stands in which relation to which resource — an agent,
harness instance, machine, skill or tool. "Who may use what" lives here and
nowhere else.

Module `github.com/kayushkin/grant-store`, root package `grantstore`, binary
`cmd/grant-store` installed at `~/bin/grant-store`. Env: `GRANT_STORE_ADDR`
(default `127.0.0.1:8315`), `GRANT_STORE_DATA_DIR` (default
`~/.config/grant-store`), and the owners a grant is checked against:
`PRINCIPAL_STORE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8314`), `LLM_BRIDGE_URL`
(`http://127.0.0.1:8160`, for agents, instances and machines),
`SKILL_STORE_URL` (`http://127.0.0.1:8301`), `TOOL_STORE_URL`
(`http://127.0.0.1:8302`) — the names dash and principal-store already use.
SQLite at `<data dir>/grant-store.db`, WAL, `?_foreign_keys=on&_txlock=immediate`.

Routes are rooted at `/`, the same as principal-store; dash adds the
`/api/grants` prefix and the auth this service has none of. All timestamps are
epoch seconds (`INTEGER`, 0 = unset).

**The bind is `127.0.0.1`, deliberately, and it is part of this contract.**
This service has no auth of its own and the front door (dash) is the only
door. The unit sets `GRANT_STORE_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8315`, `main.go` defaults to
the same, and `deploy.sh` fails if the port is listening anywhere else.

No build tag is needed: there is no full-text index here.

## The one table

### `grants`

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | `grant_000001`. What a session's audit points at |
| `seq` | monotonic, assigned here; generates `id` |
| `principal_id` | a principal-store id, human **or group**. Checked with principal-store on write; **not a foreign key** — it is another database's id |
| `relation` | one of `GET /relations`; enforced in Go against `relation.go` |
| `resource_type` | one of `GET /resource-types`; enforced in Go against `resource_type.go`, and must be a type the relation allows |
| `resource_id` | the owner's id as text. Checked with the owner on write; not a foreign key |
| `note` | free text, trimmed: why, for whoever reads the list later |
| `granted_at` | |
| `revoked_at` | 0 = active. **The only removal**; see below |

A partial unique index on `(principal_id, relation, resource_type, resource_id)
WHERE revoked_at = 0` is what makes granting the same tuple twice idempotent
while still letting a revoked row and a fresh active row for the same tuple
coexist.

**There is no hard delete.** A grant is revoked, never removed, so a session
that was offered a tool can always point at the grant that offered it, and a
list with `include_revoked=true` is the full history.

**There is no display name.** The owner renames things, so a copied name goes
stale without anyone noticing; a UI resolves names live by id.

## The relation vocabulary

Served by `GET /relations`, never hardcoded by a caller:

| Relation | Applies to | Enforced | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `can_use` | tool, skill | yes | may be offered this tool or skill in a session started as this principal |
| `can_run_as` | agent | yes | may start a session as this agent |
| `can_dispatch_on` | instance, machine | yes | may start a session on this instance or machine |
| `can_view` | board | yes (kanban-store) | may see this kanban board and its cards |
| `can_edit` | board | yes (kanban-store) | may create, move, assign and annotate cards on this board; includes `can_view` |
| `can_administer` | board | yes (kanban-store) | may change the board's settings, columns, rules and triggers, or delete it; includes `can_edit` |
| `works_with` | agent, instance, machine, skill, tool | **no** | advisory: what this principal usually works with. A card's dispatch picker reads it to put an assignee's instances first. Nothing refuses anything because of it |

**Enforced** means llm-bridge-server reads the relation at session start and
offers only what it names. As of 2026-09-11 it reads `can_use` for tools: a
session created with `principal_id` is offered the granted tools its instance
also has opted in (tool-store), provisioned by id; a principal with no such
grant gets the instance's opt-ins unchanged (lenient, the operator's choice);
`can_dispatch_on` and `can_run_as` refuse a session outside them at
create (403 `not_granted`) and at spawn, again leniently — a principal
holding none of a relation is not restricted by it; skills are stored but not
read yet. A grant pairing a relation with a type outside its
list is a 400 naming the allowed types. Nothing is normalised: `Can_Use` is a
400, not a rewrite.

The three board relations are stored as independent tuples. **kanban-store**,
not this store, decides that `can_administer` includes `can_edit` and `can_edit`
includes `can_view`, and it enforces them only when started with principal
enforcement on (see kanban-store's README). A kanban-store that enforces
answers a request with neither a principal nor its service token with 401, so
`KANBAN_STORE_SERVICE_TOKEN` must be set here for board grants to be written;
without it every board grant is a 502 quoting that 401.

`works_with` is the list principal-store used to keep as `principal_resources`
(2026-09-10 to 2026-09-11), moved here so there is one place to look.

## Routes

Errors are `{"error":"…"}`. Status mapping: not found → **404**; a malformed
or self-contradictory grant, or an id its owner says does not exist → **400**;
principal-store or a resource owner that could not be asked → **502** (nothing
is written); anything else → 500.

### `GET /health`

`{"status":"ok","counts":{"grants":N,"active":N,"revoked":N,"principals":N}}` —
`principals` is distinct principals holding an active grant.

### `GET /relations`

The table above as JSON: `[{"name","resource_types":[…],"enforced":bool,"description"}]`,
in the order shown.

### `GET /resource-types`

`["agent","instance","machine","skill","tool"]` — the same five names as
kanban-store's entity-type registry and principal-store.

### `GET /grants`

Query: `principal_id`, `relation`, `resource_type`, `resource_id`,
`include_revoked`, `limit`, `offset`. Every filter is optional and they
combine. Ordered by `resource_type, resource_id, relation, principal_id, seq`.
Bare array, `[]` when empty. An unknown `relation` or `resource_type` is a
**400** naming the vocabulary, never an empty answer, so a misspelling is not
read as "nobody has this".

`GET /grants?resource_type=tool&resource_id=13` is the reverse lookup: who
holds a grant on this tool.

### `POST /grants`

Body, decoded strictly (an unknown key is a 400):

```json
{"principal_id":"principal_000006","relation":"can_use","resource_type":"tool","resource_id":"13","note":"Playwright for e2e"}
```

Checks, in the order a caller can act on them: the relation, the resource type
and whether the relation allows it, the id shapes (`principal_…`; a numeric id
must be a plain decimal integer — a slug or a name is a 400 saying which id is
wanted), then **principal-store** is asked whether the principal exists, then
the **resource's owner** is asked whether the resource exists. Both owners are
asked before anything is written.

**201** with the grant when this call wrote it; **200** with the stored row
when an identical active tuple already exists (same `granted_at`, same
`note` — the repeat does not overwrite). A disabled principal and a disabled
resource are both accepted: the grant is dormant, and comes back with them.

### `GET /grants/{id}`

The grant, revoked or not. 404 if no such id.

### `POST /grants/{id}/revoke`

**200** with the grant. Idempotent: an already-revoked grant is returned with
its original `revoked_at`. 404 if no such id. Never asks an owner — a grant on
a resource that was deleted upstream is exactly the one most in need of
revoking, and an owner that is down must not pin a grant in place.

### `GET /principals/{id}/effective`

**The read llm-bridge-server makes at session start.** Every active grant the
principal holds, directly or through an active group it belongs to. Query:
`relation`, `resource_type` (optional filters, same vocabulary rules as
`GET /grants`).

Groups come **live from principal-store** on every call (`GET
/principals/{id}` there, which expands a human's active groups), so a
membership change shows at the next session start without this store being
told. A group's own effective set is its own rows: groups do not nest.

Each row is the grant as stored, so its `principal_id` says whether it is the
principal's own (equal to the id asked for) or inherited (a group's id). The
same resource granted both ways appears twice, because both are true, and
whoever is about to revoke the direct one needs to see the group still carries
it. Ordered by `resource_type, resource_id, relation`, the principal's own row
before inherited ones, then `principal_id`.

A principal principal-store does not know is **404**; a principal-store that
could not be asked is **502** — **never an empty list**, because an empty list
would start a session with nothing offered and no explanation.

## Owner checks

| `resource_type` | Owner asked | Id wanted |
|---|---|---|
| `agent` | llm-bridge-server `GET /agents`, scanned for the numeric id | agent-store's `agents.id`. The slug is refused: agent-store lets it be renamed |
| `instance` | llm-bridge-server `GET /instances/{id}` | harness-store's instance id, e.g. `inst-cc-local` |
| `machine` | llm-bridge-server `GET /machines/{id}` | harness-store's machine id, e.g. `m_localhost` |
| `skill` | skill-store `GET /skills/{id}` | skill-store's numeric `skills.id` |
| `tool` | tool-store `GET /tools/{id}` | tool-store's numeric `tools.id` |
| `board` | kanban-store `GET /api/boards/{id}`, sending `X-Kanban-Store-Service-Token` from `KANBAN_STORE_SERVICE_TOKEN` when set | kanban-store's board id (a uuid) |
| principal | principal-store `GET /principals/{id}` | `principal_000001`, human or group |

Each call has a 3 s timeout. A 404 whose body is Go's own `404 page not found`
(or, for principal-store, a 404 with no JSON error) is reported as a
misconfigured URL — a 502 naming the env var — not as a missing record, because
every owner answers a missing record with its own text.
