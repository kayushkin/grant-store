// The relation vocabulary is served (GET /relations) so no caller builds a
// picker out of whatever values happen to be in the rows. Each relation names
// the resource types it may pair with; a grant pairing a relation with a type
// outside that list is a 400 naming the allowed ones.
//
// can_view, can_edit and can_administer are board access, enforced by
// kanban-store when it runs with principal enforcement on. This store keeps
// them as three independent tuples; kanban-store decides that can_administer
// includes can_edit and can_edit includes can_view, because what a relation on
// a board lets someone do is the board owner's rule, not this store's.
//
// Enforced relations are the ones llm-bridge-server reads at session start:
// a session with a principal is offered only the tools and skills it can_use,
// may only run as an agent it can_run_as, and may only start on an instance
// or machine it can_dispatch_on. works_with is advisory — it is the list
// principal-store used to keep, moved here so there is one place to look —
// and nothing refuses anything because of it.
//
// A grant whose resource_id is AllResources ("*") names every resource of its
// type, including ones created after the grant. Only a relation whose
// enforcing service reads "*" accepts it: llm-bridge-server's four. kanban-store
// does not read it yet, so a board grant of "*" is refused here rather than
// stored and silently ignored there; works_with is advisory and a list of
// everything advises nothing.
//
// Nothing here is normalised: the relation arrives in a body and is stored as
// a join key, so "Can_Use" is a 400 naming the right spelling, not a rewrite.
